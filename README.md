# security-news-dashboard

A mini project to put to practice what I learnt in the [Frontend masters JavaScript the new hard parts](https://github.com/cfereday/js-the-new-hard-parts).

This project will query different APIs to get interesting daily security tech news aggregated in a simple dashboard, to make it easier to keep track of security news.

## Getting started
1. Clone the repo:
`git clone git@github.com:cfereday/security-news-dashboard.git`

2. Use the correct version of Node:
`nvm install v15.0.1`

3. Install the dependencies:
`npm install`

## To run the UI (WIP)
4. Webpack build:
`npm run build`

5. Start the app locally:
`npm run start:dev`

6. Navigate to the localhost url:
`http://localhost:9000/`

## To run the CLI tool
7. Run the script from the root directory
`node ./src/cli/index.js`
