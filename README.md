# security-news-dashboard

A mini project to put to practice what I learnt in the [Frontend masters JavaScript the new hard parts](https://github.com/cfereday/js-the-new-hard-parts).

This project will query different APIs to get interesting daily security tech news aggregated in a simple dashboard, to make it easier to keep track of security news.
